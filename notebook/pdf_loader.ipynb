Improper data \\ndistribution often leads to very slow response to user requests. \\n \\nData Allocation \\nData Allocation is an intelligent distribution of your data pieces, (called data fragments) to \\nimprove database performance and Data Availability for end-users. It aims to reduce overall \\ncosts of transaction processing while also providing accurate data rapidly in your DDBMS \\nsystems. Data Allocation is one of the key steps in building your Distributed Database Systems. \\nThere are two common strategies used in optimal Data Allocation: Data Fragmentation and \\nData Replication. \\n \\nFragmentation and Replication In Distributed Database \\n \\nData Fragmentation \\n➢ Fragmentation is a process of disintegrating relations or tables into several partitions in \\nmultiple sites.  \\n➢ It divides a database into various subtables and sub relations so that data can be \\ndistributed and stored efficiently.  \\n➢ Database Fragmentation can be of two types: horizontal or vertical.  \\n➢ In a horizontal fragmentation, each tuple of a relation r is assigned to one or more \\nfragments.  \\n➢ In vertical fragmentation, the schema for a relation r is split into numerous smaller'),\n",

The subsets of the table \\nare called fragments. Fragmentation can be of three types:  \\n➢ Horizontal Fragmentation \\n➢ Vertical Fragmentation \\n➢ Hybrid Fragmentation(combination of horizontal and vertical).  \\n➢ Horizontal fragmentation can further be classified into two techniques: primary \\nhorizontal fragmentation and derived horizontal fragmentation. \\nFragmentation should be done in a way so that the original table can be reconstructed from the \\nfragments. This is needed so that the original table can be reconstructed from the fragments \\nwhenever required. This requirement is called “reconstructiveness.” \\n \\nAdvantages of Fragmentation \\n➢ Since data is stored close to the site of usage, efficiency of the database system is \\nincreased. \\n➢ Local query optimization techniques are sufficient for most queries since data is locally \\navailable. \\n➢ Since irrelevant data is not available at the sites, security and privacy of the database \\nsystem can be maintained. \\n \\nDisadvantages of Fragmentation \\n➢ When data from different fragments are required, the access speeds may be very low. \\n➢ In case of recursive fragmentations, the job of reconstruction will need expensive \\ntechniques. \\n➢ Lack of back-up copies of data in different sites may render the database ineffective in \\ncase of failure of a site. \\n \\nVertical Fragmentation \\nIn vertical fragmentation, the fields or columns of a table are grouped into fragments. In order \\nto maintain reconstructiveness, each fragment should contain the primary key field(s) of the \\ntable. Vertical fragmentation can be used to enforce privacy of data. \\n \\nFor example, let us consider that a University database keeps records of all registered students \\nin a Student table having the following schema.'),\n",

In this case, the designer will \\nfragment the database as follows − \\n \\nCREATE TABLE STD_FEES AS  \\n   SELECT Regd_No, Fees  \\n   FROM STUDENT; \\n \\nHorizontal Fragmentation \\nHorizontal fragmentation groups the tuples of a table in accordance to values of one or more \\nfields. Horizontal fragmentation should also confirm to the rule of reconstructiveness. Each \\nhorizontal fragment must have all columns of the original base table. \\n \\nFor example, in the student schema, if the details of all students of Computer Science Course \\nneeds to be maintained at the School of Computer Science, then the designer will horizontally \\nfragment the database as follows − \\n \\nCREATE COMP_STD AS  \\n   SELECT * FROM STUDENT   \\n   WHERE COURSE = \"Computer Science\"; \\n \\nHybrid Fragmentation \\nIn hybrid fragmentation, a combination of horizontal and vertical fragmentation techniques are \\nused. This is the most flexible fragmentation technique since it generates fragments with \\nminimal extraneous information. However, reconstruction of the original table is often an \\nexpensive task. \\n \\nHybrid fragmentation can be done in two alternative ways − \\n \\n• At first, generate a set of horizontal fragments; then generate vertical fragments from \\none or more of the horizontal fragments. \\n \\n• At first, generate a set of vertical fragments; then generate horizontal fragments from \\none or more of the vertical fragments. \\n \\nData Replication \\nData replication is the process of storing separate copies of the database at two or more sites.

In this configuration, each component database has an identical schema but \\nonly a subset of the total rows. The federated database system distributes queries to the \\nappropriate component database; the goal of the system is to ensure that a typical query will \\nneed to use only one component, thus drastically reducing the number of rows that need to be \\nsearched. Microsoft SQL Server has supported this type of database federation since its 2000 \\nedition. \\n•When a federated database is used for load distribution, rows are distributed to its components \\nbased on a primary key. Ideally, most or all queries should end up hitting only one component \\ndatabase. \\n•For instance, a bank may use a federated database in which transactions are split by year. Users \\nwill often only look at transactions in the past year and the system will only need to touch one \\nor two component databases. On the other hand, splitting the databases by customer ID isn't \\nlikely to work well; a given set of transactions will involve a random distribution of customer \\nIDs, meaning that the query will be sent out to many, or potentially all, of the component \\ndatabases. This eliminates the benefit of the federated database -- nearly all of the rows end up \\nbeing searched -- and will only increase the query's overall latency because of the query \\nredirects. \\n•Federated databases have several drawbacks, according to Hilary Cotter, a SQL Server \\nconsultant and Microsoft MVP. Each component database is a potential point of failure, and \\nlatency from any one server will delay the entire call. Your clients will have to program either \\nthe federated database or its calling applications to handle potentially incomplete query results, \\nin case one or more of the component databases times out. They'll also have to manage each \\ncomponent database and keep it up to date, increasing maintenance costs. \\n• A federated database system (FDBS) is a type of meta-database management system \\n(DBMS), which transparently maps multiple autonomous database systems into a single \\nfederated database.  \\n• The constituent databases are interconnected via a computer network and may be \\ngeographically decentralized. Since the constituent database systems remain \\nautonomous, a federated database system is a contrastable alternative to the (sometimes \\ndaunting) task of merging several disparate databases.  \\n• A federated database, or virtual database, is a composite of all constituent databases in a \\nfederated database system.  \\n• There is no actual data integration in the constituent disparate databases as a result of \\ndata federation. \\n• A DBMS can be classified as either centralized or distributed. A centralized system \\nmanages a single database while distributed manages multiple databases. A component \\nDBS in a DBMS may be centralized or distributed.  \\n• A multiple DBS (MDBS) can be classified into two types depending on the autonomy of \\nthe component DBS as federated and non federated.  \\n• A nonfederated database system is an integration of component DBMS that are not \\nautonomous.  \\n• A federated database system consists of component DBS that are autonomous yet \\nparticipate in a federation to allow partial and controlled sharing of their data. \\n \\n• Federated architectures differ based on levels of integration with the component \\ndatabase systems and the extent of services offered by the federation.

Costs (Transfer of data) of Distributed Query processing : \\n \\n• In Distributed Query processing, the data transfer cost of distributed query processing \\nmeans the cost of transferring intermediate files to other sites for processing and \\ntherefore the cost of transferring the ultimate result files to the location where that \\nresult’s required.  \\n• Let’s say that a user sends a query to site S1, which requires data from its own and also \\nfrom another site S2.

This reduction in the number of tuples \\nreduces the number and the total size of the transmission that ultimately reducing the total \\ncost of data transfer. Let’s say that we have two tables R1, R2 on Site S1, and S2. Now, we \\nwill forward the joining column of one table say R1 to the site where the other table say R2 is \\nlocated. This column is joined with R2 at that site. The decision whether to reduce R1 or R2 \\ncan only be made after comparing the advantages of reducing R1 with that of reducing R2. \\nThus, semi-join is a well-organized solution to reduce the transfer of data in distributed query \\nprocessing. \\n \\nExample : Find the amount of data transferred to execute the same query given in the above \\nexample using semi-join operation. \\n \\nAnswer : The following strategy can be used to execute the query. \\n \\nSelect all (or Project) the attributes of the EMPLOYEE table at site 1 and then transfer them \\nto site 3. For this, we will transfer NAME, DID(EMPLOYEE) and the size is 25 * 1000 = \\n25000 bytes. \\nTransfer the table DEPARTMENT to site 3 and join the projected attributes of EMPLOYEE \\nwith this table. The size of the DEPARTMENT table is 25 * 50 = 1250 \\nApplying the above scheme, the amount of data transferred to execute the query will be \\n25000 + 1250 = 26250 bytes.'),\n",

Theimportant characteristics of the web graph are \\nthe following: \\n(a) It is quite volatile.  \\n(b) It is sparse. A graph is considered sparse if its average degree (i.e., the averageof the degrees \\nof all of its vertices) is less than the number of vertices. This means that the each vertex of the \\ngraph has a limited number of neighbors, evenif the vertices are in general connected.  \\n(c) It is “self-organizing.” The web contains a number of communities, eachof which consists of \\na set of pages that focus on a particular topic. Thesecommunities get organized on their own \\nwithout any “centralized control,” andgive rise to the particular subgraphs in the web graph. \\n(d) It is a “small-world graph.” This property is related to sparseness—each nodein the graph \\nmay not have many neighbors (i.e., its degree may be small), butmany nodes are connected \\nthrough intermediaries. Small-world networks werefirst identified in social sciences where it was \\nnoted that many people who arestrangers to each other are connected by intermediaries. This \\nholds true in webgraphs as well in terms of the connectedness of the graph. \\n(e) It is a power law graph. The in- and out-degree distributions of the web graphfollow power \\nlaw distributions. This means that the probability that a vertex hasin- (out-) degree iis \\nproportional to 1/iα for some α >1. The value of α isabout 2.1 for in-degree and about 7.2 for \\nout-degree.'),\n",

It \\nhas a strongly connected component (the knot inthe middle) in which there is a path between \\neach pair of pages.  \\nWeb Search \\nWeb search involves finding “all” the web pages that are relevant (i.e., have contentrelated) to \\nkeyword(s) that a user specifies. Naturally, it is not possible to find all thepages, or even to know \\nif one has retrieved all the pages; thus the search is performedon a database of web pages that \\nhave been collected and indexed. Since there areusually multiple pages that are relevant to a \\nquery, these pages are presented to the \\nuser in ranked order of relevance as determined by the search engine. In every search engine the \\ncrawler plays one of the most crucial roles. A crawleris a program used by a search engine to \\nscan the web on its behalf and collectdata about web pages. A crawler is given a starting set of \\npages—more accurately,it is given a set of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that identify \\nthese pages. \\nThe crawler retrieves and parses the page corresponding to that URL, extracts any URLs in it, \\nandadds these URLs to a queue. In the next cycle, the crawler extractsa URL from the queue \\n(based on some order) and retrieves the corresponding page.This process is repeated until the \\ncrawler stops. A control module is responsible fordeciding which URLs should be visited next. \\nThe retrieved pages are stored in apage repository. The indexer module is responsible for \\nconstructing indexes on the pages that havebeen downloaded by the crawler.While many \\ndifferent indexes can be built, the twomost common ones are text indexes and link indexes. In \\norder to construct a text \\nindex, the indexer module constructs a large “lookup table” that can provide all theURLs that \\npoint to the pages where a given word occurs. A link index describes thelink structure of the web \\nand provides information on the in-link and out-link stateof pages. The ranking module is \\nresponsible for sorting a large number of results so thatthose that are considered to be most \\nrelevant to the user’s search are presentedfirst. The problem of ranking has drawn increased \\ninterest in order to go beyondtraditional information retrieval (IR) techniques to address the \\nspecial characteristicsof the web—web queries are usually small and they are executed over a \\nvast amountof data.'),\n",

The random graph model, also known as the Erdos–Renyi \\n(ER) model, assumes n nodes and a link between each pair of nodes with probability p, \\nleading to n(n –1)p/2 edges.

It is often observed that term \\ninformation system and information technology are used interchangeably. In a literal \\nsense, information technology is a subset of information systems. Information systems \\nconsist of people, processes, machines and information technology. The great \\nadvancement in information systems is due to development in information technology \\nand introduction of computers. \\n \\nInformation System \\n \\nAn information system can be defined as set of coordinated network of components, \\nwhich act together towards producing, distributing and or processing information. An \\nimportant characteristic of computer-based information systems information is \\nprecision, which may not apply to other types. \\nIn any given organization information system can be classified based on the usage of the \\ninformation. Therefore, information systems in business can be divided into operations \\nsupport system and management support system. \\n \\nInformation Technology \\n \\nEveryday knowingly or unknowingly, everyone is utilizing information technology. It \\nhas grown rapidly and covers many areas of our day to day life like movies, mobile \\nphones, the internet, etc. \\nInformation technology can be broadly defined as integration of computer with \\ntelecommunication equipment for storing, retrieving, manipulating and storage of data. \\nAccording to Information Technology Association of America, information technology \\nis defined as “the study, design, development, application, implementation, support or \\nmanagement of computer-based information systems.” \\nInformation technology greatly enhances the performance of economy; it provides edge \\nin solving social issues as well as making information system affordable and user \\nfriendly. \\nInformation technology has brought big change in our daily life be it education, life at \\nhome, work place, communication and even in function of government. \\n \\nComparison of Information System and Information Technology \\n \\nInformation system and information technology are similar in many ways but at the \\nsame time they are different.

Similarly, information \\ntechnology is seeing constant changes with evermore faster processor and constantly \\nshrinking size of storage devices. \\n• \\nBusiness Application: Businesses have been using information systems for \\nexample in form of manual books of accounts to modern TALLY. The mode of \\ncommunication has also gone under big change, for example, from a letter to email. \\nInformation technology has helped drive efficiency across organization with improved \\nproductivity and precision manufacturing. \\n \\nFuture of Information System and Information Technology \\n \\nInformation technology has shown exponential growth in the last decade, leading to \\nmore sophisticated information systems. Today’s information technology has \\ntremendously improved quality of life. Modern medicine has benefited the most with \\nbetter information system using the latest information technology. \\nInformation systems have been known to mankind in one form or the other as a resource \\nfor decision making. However, with the \\n \\nCLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEM \\n \\nIn any given organization information system can be classified based on the usage of the \\ninformation. Therefore, an information system in an organization can be divided into \\noperations support system and management support system. \\n• \\nOperations support system \\nIn an organization, data input is done by the end user which is processed to generate \\ninformation products i.e. reports, which are utilized by internal and or external users. \\nSuch a system is called operation support system. \\nThe purpose of the operation support system is to facilitate business transaction, control \\nproduction, support internal as well as external communication and update organization \\ncentral database. The operation support system is further divided into a transaction-\\nprocessing system, processing control system and enterprise collaboration system. \\n• \\nTransaction Processing System (TPS) \\nIn manufacturing organization, there are several types of transaction across department. \\nTypical organizational departments are Sales, Account, Finance, Plant, Engineering, \\nHuman Resource and Marketing. Across which following transaction may occur sales \\norder, sales return, cash receipts, credit sales; credit slips, material accounting, inventory \\nmanagement, depreciation accounting, etc. \\nThese transactions can be categorized into batch transaction processing, single \\ntransaction processing and real time transaction processing. \\n• \\nProcess Control System \\nIn a manufacturing organization, certain decisions are made by a computer system \\nwithout any manual intervention. In this type of system, critical information is fed to the \\nsystem on a real-time basis thereby enabling process control. This kind of systems is \\nreferred as process control systems.'),\n",

A system which enables collaborative effort by improving \\ncommunication and sharing of data is referred to as an enterprise collaboration system. \\n• \\nManagement Support System \\nManagers require precise information in a specific format to undertake an organizational \\ndecision. A system which facilitates an efficient decision making process for managers \\nis called management support system. \\nManagement support systems are essentially categorized as management information \\nsystem, decision support system, expert system and accounting information system. \\nManagement information system provides information to manager facilitating the \\nroutine decision-making process. Decision support system provides information to \\nmanager facilitating specific issue related solution. \\n \\nPRESENTATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS \\n \\nThere are various information systems, and the type of information system a business \\nuses depends on its goal and objective. Here are the four main types of information \\nsystems: \\nOperations support systems – The first type of information system is the operation \\nsupport system. Such type of information system mainly supports a specific type of \\noperation in a business. An example is the transaction processing system used in all \\nbanks worldwide. This type of information system enables the service provider to assess \\na specific process of business. \\nManagement information systems – This is the second category of information \\nsystems, consisting of hardware and software integration allowing the organisation to \\nperform its core functions. They help in obtaining data from various online systems. The \\ndata thus obtained is not stored by the system; rather, it is analysed in a productive \\nmanner to help in the management of an organisation. \\nDecision support systems – An organisation can make an informed decision about its \\noperations using decision support systems. It analyses the rapidly changing information \\nthat cannot be determined in advance. It can be used in completely automated systems \\nand human-operated systems. However, for maximum efficiency combination of human \\nand computer-operated systems is recommended. \\nExecutive information systems – EIS or executive support system is the last category \\nthat serves as management support systems. They help in making senior-level decisions \\nfor an organisation. \\n \\nFacts of information systems \\n \\nThe products of information technology are part of our daily lives. Here are some of the \\nfacts about information systems. \\n \\n• Necessary for businesses to growEvery organisation has computer-related operations \\nthat are critical to getting the job done. In a business, there may be a need for computer \\nsoftware, implementation of network architecture to achieve the company’s objectives \\nor designing apps, websites, or games. So, any company that is looking to secure its \\nfuture needs to integrate a well-designed information system.'),\n",

As manual data may cost a lot of \\ntime, information systems can be very helpful in it. Information system stores data in a \\nsophisticated manner, making the process of finding the data much easier. \\n \\n•Better decision making Information system helps a business in its decision-making \\nprocess. With an information system, delivering all the important information is easier \\nto make better decisions. In addition, an information system allows employees to \\ncommunicate effectively. As the documents are stored in folders, it is easier to share and \\naccess them with the employees. \\n \\n \\nBASICS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS \\n \\nInformation is data that has been processed into a form that is meaningful to the user. \\nAn information system (IS) is an organized combination of people, hardware, software, \\ncommunications network, and data resources that collects, transforms and disseminates \\ninformation in an organization. Information systems and technologies have become a \\nvital component of businesses and organizations. People rely on information systems to \\ncommunicate with each other using a variety of physical devices (hardware), \\ninformation processing instructions and procedures (software), communication channels \\n(networks), and stored data (data resources). Information can be classified into facts, \\nopinions, concepts, procedures, processes, principles, primary information, and \\nsecondary information. Apart from this, it can also be classified into several types based \\non its nature, usage, creation, application, structure, and form. \\n \\n \\nIn order to present the information in a proper manner to the user, the data can be \\ncollected through two main methods - primary and secondary. Primary data collection \\nrefers to collecting original data or collecting data directly from the source. Secondary \\ndata collection refers to collecting data from secondary sources such as books, journals, \\nresearch reports, online databases, Internet, etc. The user should check whether this data \\nhas been updated before analyzing the data and drawing conclusions. \\n \\nThe transmission of information between one person and another, takes place with the \\nhelp of the communications system. Summarization and message routing are the two \\nmethods that increase the sending and receiving efficiency of the system. Individuals \\ntend to exercise discretion over the content or distribution of information by message \\ndelay, message modification or filtering, inference or uncertainty absorption, and \\npresentation bias. \\n \\nThe benefits of information in organizations include – it helps in management control, it \\nhelps in decision-making, and it helps to build models, backgrounds, and motivation. \\nQuality of information is also a vital issue. The term 'quality' is subjective in nature and \\nhence its parameters should be clearly defined in order to judge the quality of \\ninformation. The various parameters of quality are validity, consistency, reliability, \\nimpartiality, and age. \\n \\n Errors and bias occur as a result of giving too much importance and preference to the \\nquantity of information rather than the quality.

Information systems consist of \\npeople resources (end users and IS specialists), hardware resources (machines and \\nmedia), software (programs and procedures), data (data and knowledge bases), and \\nnetworks (communications media and network support) to perform input, processing, \\noutput, storage, and control activities that convert data resources into information \\nproducts. \\n \\nSome of the important activities performed by an IS are processing of data into \\ninformation, storage of data resources and control of system performance. Information \\nsystems perform three vital roles in any type of organization. They support business \\noperations, support managerial decision- making, and provide strategic competitive \\nadvantage to the organization.  \\n \\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS \\n \\nThe features and functions of information systems play a key role in helping businesses \\nto make better, more informed decisions. Information systems aren’t merely computers, \\ninstead they involve a combination of data, technology and people. \\n \\nFeatures of information systems \\n \\nData \\nWhen data is entered in to an information system, it has to be entered in a way that can \\nbe managed and processed. When the data is processed it turns data into information \\nwhich is then output to end users of the system. The data is generated from various \\nsources such as different departments of a business as well as external sources. The data \\nmust be accurate or else the information output can be inaccurate or misleading. \\nPeople \\nGetting data and processing it involves the use of people in order to create information \\nfor specific uses or purposes that are relevant to a business. Staff training and skills in \\nrelation to information systems are important so that a business can get the most out of \\nits information system. \\nHardware \\nThe hardware that IT systems use has to be capable of running the software required by \\nthe business and also be capable of handling a large amount of data and information \\nprocessing. The hardware should be kept up to date which enables the fast capture, \\nstorage and use of data. \\nSoftware \\nThe software that is used by businesses and the staff has to have the necessary features \\nand functionality so that it can produce and use the information created by a business. \\nThe software should also have the features necessary for staff to carry out their work \\nefficiently, for example: to analyse and process data and reports. \\nTelecommunications \\nThe information that is produced by various departments in a business needs to be \\nshared around a business as it will be used for different purposes. For doing this the \\ntelecommunications in a business needs to be effective so that the information shared \\nand distributed goes to the correct destination after being processed.'),\n",

Regular \\nbackups and various summaries should be completed to avoid losing any important data \\ndue to errors. The backups should also be stored in a geographically different location to \\navoid any major disasters such as flooding or fires etc.. which could impact on both the \\noriginal data storage and the backup data storage. \\n \\nProcessing \\n  \\nA process is a function which transforms data into information. A simple process \\nwould be adding up a number of items that is sold by a business by a variable such as \\nthe location of a store or the product or the time and date.

It defines the flow of information within the system. \\nThe objective of an information system is to provide appropriate information to the user, \\nto gather the data, process the data and communicate information to the user of the \\nsystem.  \\n \\n \\n \\nFig 4.1  Classification of Information Systems \\n \\nComponents of the information system are as follows:  \\n \\n1.Computer Hardware:  \\nPhysical equipment used for input, output and processing. The hardware structure \\ndepends upon the type and size of the organization. It consists of an input and an output \\ndevice, operating system, processor, and media devices. This also includes computer \\nperipheral devices.  \\n \\n2. Computer Software:  \\n \\nThe programs/ application program used to control and coordinate the hardware \\ncomponents. It is used for analysing and processing of the data. These programs include \\na set of instruction used for processing information.'),\n",

Softwares are used for organizing and serving data to the user, \\nmanaging physical storage of media and virtual resources. As the hardware can’t work \\nwithout software the same as software needs data for processing. Data are managed \\nusing Database management system.

A distributed system can be used efficiently when information is generated by one of \\nthe users and shared by the users working at other nodes of the system. This facility may be \\nuseful in many ways.  \\nThe use of distributed computing systems by a group of users to work cooperatively is known \\nas computer-supported cooperative working (CSCW), or groupware. Groupware applications \\nare primarily based on the sharing of data objects between programs running on different \\nnodes of a distributed computer system. Groupware is an emerging technology that holds \\nmajor promise for software developers. \\nIt consists of computer programs where people work on common project but are separated \\ngeographically. They share the interface for communication and it is done with the help of \\ngroupware. alternative name of groupware is collaboration software.

This type of communication includes \\nbrochures, advertising, contact letters/direct mail, telephone calls, business cards, Web \\nsites, and anything else that makes the public aware of what you do.  A couple of things \\nto remember about external communication: \\no Image is extremely important in external corporate communications! Your logo \\nshould represent who you are. \\no Consistency is also very important. Use the same words and messages to \\ncommunicate externally about your business. \\n• \\nInternal communication with team members is essential to attracting and retaining a \\ntalented staff and monitoring business performance. Consistent communication about \\nbusiness goals will provide direction to the people in your company and make sure \\neveryone is working toward the same objective.  Internal communication can be \\ndesigned to motivate your team. Methods for communicating internally include \\nperformance awards, newsletters, meetings, telephone calls, and both formal and \\ninformal discussions. Periodic meetings with top project management groups, including \\nyour board of directors and advisory board, should be planned for regular intervals \\n every year.  \\no As with external communication, consistency is very important. Use the same \\nwords and messages with all members of your team to make sure everyone is on \\nthe same page. \\no Many large companies print key messages and goals on employee badges and ID \\ncards so that every person in the organization has the same words at their \\nfingertips. \\n \\nBasic Communication Tools \\n \\nA wide variety of communication tools are used for external and internal communication. \\n These tools include mail, email, telephones, cell phones, smartphones, computers, video and \\nweb conferencing tools, social networking, as well as online collaboration and productivity \\nplatforms. \\nMail \\nEven with all the modern methods of communication, regular postal mail is still a powerful tool \\nfor a business.

There are many types of telephones, and only you can decide which type is right for \\nyou. Even the standard telephone (landline) that is installed in your office has many options. \\nWhile you may have a telephone already, you should start with at least one line that is unique to \\nyour business. This line should have the capability to take messages in case it is not answered \\npersonally. Here are some telephone tips: \\n• \\nIt is important to treat the telephone as a business tool. Answer your phone in a timely \\nmanner (within three rings if you can). Always identify yourself when answering. \\nRecord a voicemail message that identifies the number, provides brief information about \\nyour business, and indicates when you will return the call. Then continually check your \\nvoicemail to return calls promptly. \\n• \\nHave a separate line for your business phone and your personal phone. Don't have \\nfamily members pick up or use the business phone. Get any required extra telephone \\nlines installed before you start. \\n• \\nWhen leaving phone messages, clearly state your company’s name and phone number at \\nthe beginning and the end of the message. \\n• \\nBe polite in cell phone use! Good business courtesy includes avoiding being interrupted \\nby telephone calls, texts, or email when in a meeting or during a business lunch..  \\nLandline \\nThe landline is the telephone system that uses a physical wire for transmission. You may have a \\nlandline in your home, your office, or at a public phone location. If the internet is unreliable, \\nyou will still be able to use your landline because it relies on a different technology for \\ncommunication. There are many services available for landline telephones. If you have an \\nexisting landline and would like to add additional services such as voicemail, multiple lines, \\nand conference calling, be sure to research the options offered by your service provider and its \\ncompetitors.  You may not have to switch phone companies to get the features you want. \\nCell Phones/Mobile Phones \\nThe cell phone, also called a mobile phone, is used for mobile communications. There are \\nnumerous carriers/providers and plans. Many carriers have plans tailored for small businesses \\nincluding options that bundle popular features and usage patterns making them very cost \\neffective. Be sure to ask questions about your specific needs before selecting a carrier and a \\nplan. Understand the duration and terms of your agreement. Many can be two years or more. \\n Consider what type of communication you will use most for your business - conversations over \\nthe phone, texting, or data.

Smartphones are \\ncapable of text messaging and include a camera with video capability. \\nOutside your office, a smartphone can be a valuable tool for business. In fact, if you don’t have \\nan office, or work from your home, a smartphone can be your office. With a smartphone you \\ncan use email, access the internet, review, edit, or scan documents, use GPS, accept and make \\npayments, and use a multitude of applications (apps) to do almost anything. The most popular \\nsmartphones are the Apple iPhone (iOs) and Samsung Galaxy (Android), but new smartphones \\nare emerging on the market everyday. Each has different strengths you will need to factor into \\nyour business needs. \\nInternet Calling: Google Voice and Others \\nInternet calling is a way to make phone calls using the internet. There are several internet \\ncalling providers. Google Voice is the most popular and it is free. Google Voice provides \\nvoicemail, Short Message Service (SMS) and texting, and a local phone number.  Users can \\nsend free text messages, customize their voicemail, read voicemail text transcript, and more. \\nUsers can make or receive calls or texts from their computer or from their mobile smartphone. \\nGoogle’s voicemail service is now available for free to all Gmail users. Other internet calling \\nproviders include Grasshopper, MightyCall, Nextiva, DingTone, Telzio, Freedompop, Line2, \\nVoiceably, and OnSIP, to name a few. Each provides a service for a monthly fee with different \\nfeatures, capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses. \\nSMS Messaging and Texting \\nWhile not all mobile phones are smartphones capable of receiving videos and pictures, nearly \\nall mobile phones can receive SMS (short message service) messages. These are texts of less \\nthan 160 characters that consist only of letters, numbers, and symbols. SMS messaging, and \\ntexting in general, is a powerful way to communicate. SMS messaging and texting provide one-\\nto-one communication. As more and more people adopt mobile phones, there are more \\nopportunities to connect directly and personally with mobile phone users (who may be your \\ncustomers!). \\nCompanies can use SMS messages as a way to remind customers of sales, product offerings, \\nand other announcements. It is important to note that customers must opt-in to companies’ SMS \\nmarketing campaigns and that it is illegal for companies to send SMS messages to customers \\nwho have not opted-in. Companies can often encourage customers to opt-in by offering them \\nsomething in exchange. For example, a hot dog company could get customers to participate in \\ntheir SMS marketing campaign by offering them $5 off their next meal for texting a code to \\ntheir specialized SMS campaign number. Larger companies might purchase the services of an \\nonline text message marketing company to manage these marketing campaigns and to provide'),\n",

Pre-paid allows you \\nto pay a mobile carrier upfront for mobile services, and you must refill your minutes or data \\nwhen they run out. Be aware that overage charges for minutes or data used that exceed your \\nplan may be billed at a higher rate. You will need to understand if it is possible to go over your \\npre-paid amount, and what additional charges might be imposed. Post-paid plans allow you to \\nsign a contract with a mobile carrier for different types of mobile services, and you pay for \\nthose services at the end of the month. Unused minutes or data may or may not roll over from \\none month to the next month, meaning you have to pay for your minutes or data each month \\nwhether you use it all or not. \\nWhichever plan you choose, be sure you understand the terms.  There may be penalties for \\nterminating your contract early. You should think about your business needs before deciding on \\na mobile service plan and whether you want to pay upfront or at the end of the month. \\nVideo and Web Conferencing \\nVideo conferencing provides a way to have face-to-face meetings without the expense of travel. \\nIt provides a more personal way to communicate both externally with customers and partners \\nand internally with team members or employees who may work outside the office. \\nVideo conferencing technologies transmit and receive images and voice in real-time so that you \\ncan have a “face-to-face meeting.” Web conferencing adds another dimension - it allows you to \\nshare documents and applications during your online meeting. Both options allow you the \\nflexibility to have one-on-one meetings, or conferences with multiple attendees. Seeing facial \\nexpressions and nonverbal cues during crucial business discussions and negotiations can be \\ninvaluable for your business. \\nSome common tools for video and web conferencing are listed below. These tools are offered at \\ndifferent levels and price points, although there are some you can access for free. Some \\nexamples of video and web conferencing tools include: \\n• \\nGoogle+ Hangouts \\n• \\nSkype \\n• \\nZoom \\n• \\nRing Central \\n• \\nWebex \\n• \\nGoto Meeting \\nAll these solutions allow you to communicate as if you were face-to-face with customers, \\npartners, and employees anywhere in the world. Time and money that would be spent on \\ntraveling can be used other ways for your business. You can share documents, make \\npresentations, and conduct meetings on short notice. For example, without leaving your office,'),\n",

A social network is an online \\ncommunity comprised of individuals or organizations that are tied together by common \\ninterests. Internet-based social networking occurs through a variety of website platforms that \\nallow users with similar interests to share content and interact online. Some popular social \\nnetworking sites include Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, and \\nmany others. \\nBy creating social networks that follow your business, or the interests of your business, you can \\n build relationships with current and future customers. For example, there are online social \\nnetworks for companies, celebrities, politicians, and interests such as travel, home decor, \\ncooking, and exercise to name a few. By posting content to these groups you can provide \\ninformation to a large number of followers quickly and inexpensively. \\nMany companies pursue a social media strategy in their marketing efforts. Social media \\nmarketing is a relatively inexpensive way to reach specific customer segments that you believe \\nwill be interested in your product or service. To be successful it requires a steady effort and \\nparticipation over time. One mistake companies make is jumping in and posting frequently \\ninitially, but then not maintaining the effort for very long. It’s better to begin with a pace you \\nknow you can continue, whether it’s once a month, once a week, or once a day. If you find you \\nhave more content to post, you can always do more. A note of caution on internet social \\nnetworking: once you put something out there it's hard to take it back, so you have to be careful. \\nAlways be mindful of how a post will represent and reflect on your business. It’s also a good \\nidea to keep in mind that your personal social networks may also be visited by potential \\ncustomers, partners, investors, and employees. \\nOnline Collaboration Tools \\nThe world is at our fingertips when it comes to being able to work online within our business, \\nwith partners, vendors and/or customers/consumers. From messaging to group chats, video \\nconferencing, file sharing, document collaboration, elearning, and more, almost anything is \\npossible right from your device.

In a transaction one or more of the data \\noperations are performed such as insert, update, delete or retrieve. All this process is automated \\nand if performed, is performed in completion or is not at all performed. The transaction that \\ndoes not include any updating of data but only involve in retrieving the data is known as read-\\nonly transaction. \\nA high level operation is divided into many low level operations. For instance, the operation of \\ndata updation is divided into three different low level operations - \\n➢ read_item() – The data items from the storage till the main memory is read. \\n➢ modify_item() – The value of the item in the main memory is changed \\n➢ write_item() – The modified value from the main memory is written to storage. \\nThe access of the database is only restricted to the operations, read_item() and write_item(). \\nTherefore, the basic database operations for any transaction include read and write. \\nWhat are the different Transaction Operations? \\nThe operations that can be performed in a transaction at low level are: \\n➢ begin_transaction – The start of the transaction execution is specified by this marker. \\n➢ read_item or write_item – As a part of transaction, the operations of main memory are \\ninterleaved with the operations of the database. \\n➢ end_transaction – The end of the transaction is specified by this marker. \\n➢ commit – The successful completion of the transaction in its entirety is specified by \\nthis signal. \\n➢ rollback – The failure of the transaction and the status that the temporary changes are \\nundone in the database is specified by this signal. Once the transaction is committed, it \\ncannot be rolled back. \\nWhat are the different states of Transaction? \\nThere are set of five different states, which a transaction needs to go through.

There is no existence or no place for partial update of the \\ntransaction. \\n➢ Consistency – Without effecting the data item in the database, the database need to be \\ntaken from one consistent state to another consistent state by a transaction. \\n➢ Isolation – There should be any interference to the transaction from any other \\ntransactions which are running simultaneously. The transaction should be executed as a \\nsole transaction in the system. \\n➢ Durability – The change brought by the committed transaction should be durable in the \\ndatabase and should not go away or get lost in case of failure transactions. \\nWhat are Schedules in Distributed DBMS? \\nThe total order of the execution of the operations considered in a system with many \\nsimultaneous transactions is known as a schedule.

Financial information system:- FIS is a sub-system of organizational management \\ninformation system. This sub-system supports the decision-making process of financial \\nfunctions at the level of an organization .  \\n2. Marketing information system:- This sub system of MIS provides information about various \\nfunctions of the marketing system of an organization. Marketing is another functional area of \\nthe business organization ,which is engaged in marketing (selling)of its products to its \\ncustomers.  \\n \\nImportant functions of the marketing process include the following :- \\n • The marketing identification function  \\n• The purchase motivation function  \\n• The product adjustment function \\n • The physical distribution function \\n • The communication function \\n • The post –transaction function \\n \\n3. Production/ Marketing information system :- manufacturing or production information \\nsystem provides information on production / operation activities of an organization and thus \\nfacilitates the decision –making process of production manage process of an organization . The \\nmain decision to be taken in manufacturing system is product design.  \\n \\n4. Human Resource Information System:- this functional information system supports the \\nfunctions of human resource management of an organization . The human resource \\nmanagement function ,in its narrow sense , it also known as personnel management .  \\nThe function involves :  \\n• Manpower planning  \\n• Staffing • Training and development  \\n• Performance evaluation \\n• Separation activites \\n \\nCharacteristics of Functional Information System  \\n➢ Many small changes in a large database  \\n➢ Systematic records ( mostly numerical )  \\n➢ Routine actions & updating .  \\n➢ Data preparation is a large & important effort \\n \\nEQUIPMENTS REQUIREMENTS OF FUNCTIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS'),\n",
